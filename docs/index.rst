Python Microservices
====================
Python Microservice Scaffold is an example of how to structure a Flask Microservice Project.
This Scaffold is build over `PyMS <https://github.com/python-microservices/pyms>`_ package. PyMS is a `Microservice chassis pattern <https://microservices.io/patterns/microservice-chassis.html>`_
like Spring Boot (Java) or Gizmo (Golang). PyMS is a collection of libraries, best practices and recommended ways to build
microservices with Python which handles cross-cutting concerns:

* Externalized configuration
* Logging
* Health checks
* Metrics (TODO)
* Distributed tracing
